# COMP47360_DublinBUS

This project is a DublinBus application, which helps the user to plan their journey around Dublin. We have implemented a couple of cool features as well along with the journey planning.

Check out the live application here: http://ipa-013.ucd.ie/

### Near Me Feature

The user can toggle the radius or the number of stops near the user's location to be displayed. When user clicks on a stop, the trips from the stop is taken and cross referenced with GTFSR for real time updates and trips are shown to the user with an added delay.
